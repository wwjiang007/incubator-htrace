Building HTrace
===============

Building HTrace requires

* Java 1.7 at least.
* Apache Maven 3.0.4
* Go programming language, version 1.4 or higher (for htrace-htraced)
* The development package for leveldb (for htrace-htraced)

Note that at the moment, only Maven 3.0.4 should be used to create HTrace
releases - see [HTRACE-236](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTRACE-236)
(Support building release artifacts with Maven versions other than 3.0.4) for
details.

After installing dependencies, to build, run:

   $ mvn install

To build a tarball, do:

   $ mvn clean install -DskipTests assembly:single -Pdist

This will build a tarball into ./target.

To skip the rat-check -- it can take a while -- pass
a -Drat.skip on the  mvn command-line.


See htrace-htraced/BUILDING.txt for more information to build htrace-htraced.
